*October 26, 2025*

## Overview
This week felt like a turning point in how I approached both design and problem-solving. I spent a lot of time refining my project and thinking more deeply about how all the pieces fit together — not just the visuals or layout, but the overall experience from a user’s perspective.

## Design and User Experience
I started paying more attention to how design choices shape emotion and behavior, realizing that something as small as a word choice or color adjustment can completely change how a user interprets a system. I also focused on making my work feel more purposeful and cohesive, ensuring that every interaction aligned with the project’s main goal of clarity and accessibility.

## Reflection Beyond Class
As the week went on, I became more reflective about how these ideas apply beyond class. I began noticing how apps, websites, and university systems around me succeed or fail to communicate effectively. It’s made me appreciate thoughtful design in a new way — the kind that makes things feel intuitive rather than overwhelming.

## Challenges
One ongoing challenge was balancing creativity with structure; I wanted to explore new ideas while also staying organized and meeting deadlines. It took some discipline to pace myself and avoid overcomplicating things.

## Takeaway
Overall, Week 9 reminded me that good design isn’t just about technical skill — it’s about empathy, iteration, and understanding how even small choices can make a big difference in someone’s experience.
