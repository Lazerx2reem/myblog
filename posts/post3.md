Week 3 Reflection

## Learning:

This week, I used AI to try out a Smart Fit Coach app that gives workout plans and tips based on different users. I learned that AI can help make workouts personal and suggest small improvements based on habits and progress.

## Connection:

I looked at how beginners, intermediate, and advanced users might use the app. AI helped me figure out which features, like reminders, tips, or exercise adjustments, would be most useful. It was like testing with different people without needing real users.

## Challenges:

It was tricky to make the AI suggestions realistic and fair for everyone. I also had to think about privacy and making sure AI doesn’t give biased or weird advice.

## AI Tool:

Used ChatGPT to simulate users and their feedback

## Ethical AI Learnings:
I realized it’s important to protect user info, explain how AI makes suggestions, and make sure the advice is fair and safe. AI should help users, not confuse or mislead them.
