## What I did this time:

This week, I used Gemini and Bolt to create a prototype and storyboard based on interview insights.  Small features such as step-by-step checklists and reminders greatly simplified chores for users. 

## How I can Relate to this:

As an international student, I could relate to the persona's emphasis on clarity, instruction, and privacy.  The objective was to incorporate participant suggestions, such as a Help/FAQ and clearer deadlines, without making the interface cluttered. 

## How it helped:

Testing numerous AI-generated alternatives helped me choose the ideal layout, and I concluded that while AI speeds up design, attentive user experience remains essential.
