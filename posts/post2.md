Week 2 Reflection

## Key Learning:

 This week, we discussed AI for good versus AI with no particular goal in mind. It was surprising to realize how many AI tools have been created, yet using them for truly positive impact remains a challenge. I also discovered several AI tools targeted specifically at students, which could help streamline learning and creative tasks.

## Personal Connection: 

Inspired by the many possibilities to use AI for good, I explored Perplexity AI to research potential topics where I could make a meaningful contribution. This helped me narrow down ideas and see how AI can support goal-oriented work.

## Challenges: 
It was initially overwhelming to see the sheer number of AI tools available and decide which ones could genuinely be used for positive impact. I had to focus on evaluating each tool critically and identifying areas where I could personally contribute.
