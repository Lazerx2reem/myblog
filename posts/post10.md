# Reflection and Learning: WellMind AI Development Plan

## Overview
Although I have not yet completed the WellMind AI project, I have created a detailed development plan and roadmap. This reflection outlines the key aspects I intend to focus on while working on the project, as well as the lessons I hope to learn through implementation.

---

## Key Considerations and Learning Goals

### 1. Feature Prioritization
- I plan to use the **MoSCoW method** to prioritize features for the MVP. I anticipate learning how to balance essential features like the AI wellness coach, logging, and trend visualization against secondary features such as gamification or adaptive recommendations.
- I aim to critically evaluate AI suggestions for prioritization and consider **user engagement, technical feasibility, and development timeline** when making final decisions.

### 2. Technical Decision-Making
- I intend to follow the stack outlined in my plan (React.js frontend, Firebase backend, Firestore database, GPT-4 API) and observe how these technologies integrate in practice.
- While working on the project, I hope to understand **how to connect frontend and backend securely**, manage real-time data, and integrate AI responses effectively.
- I also plan to explore **trade-offs between speed of development and long-term maintainability** when choosing technologies and architectures.

### 3. Task Breakdown and Time Management
- I want to implement tasks in small, manageable increments, starting with **core Must-Have features** like logging, AI chat interface, and trend visualization.
- I aim to follow the proposed 5-week roadmap while tracking time and dependencies, so I can learn **how to estimate development effort accurately and manage a timeline** for an MVP.

### 4. Risk Awareness and Mitigation
- I will keep potential risks in mind, such as:
  - GPT-4 API usage costs
  - Integration challenges between Firebase and AI
  - Delays due to feature complexity
- By addressing these risks early, I hope to **develop proactive problem-solving and contingency planning skills**.

### 5. AI-Assisted Planning
- Using AI for planning has highlighted how it can help in **breaking down tasks, prioritizing features, and identifying risks**.
- While implementing the project, I plan to test and adjust AI-generated suggestions to understand **where human judgment is necessary** versus where AI recommendations can be applied directly.

---

## Personal Learning Goals
- Learn how to implement **an AI-powered wellness app** from start to finish.
- Understand **the interactions between frontend, backend, and AI APIs** in a real project.
- Practice **feature prioritization, task scheduling, and risk management** in a software development context.
- Develop the ability to **critically assess AI suggestions** and make informed technical decisions.
- Gain confidence in **building an MVP with realistic timelines and dependencies**.

## Conclusion
Even though the project is not yet complete, I consider this planning exercise valuable for preparing me to manage and execute the development process. By keeping these considerations in mind, I aim to develop both technical and project management skills while building WellMind AI.
