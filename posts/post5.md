Week 5 Reflection

This week I tested my idea for a student wellness tracker with three friends. I went in thinking people would love an all-in-one app that logs mood, sleep, hydration, workouts, and connects to an AI therapist. The interviews showed me a more nuanced picture.

The big surprise? Privacy was everyone’s first worry. I thought the main challenge would be getting people to log consistently, but students were way more concerned about whether their data would stay safe. The other theme was simplicity—if logging takes more than a few seconds, they’ll quit.

What I took away:

One app is better than juggling many, but it has to feel effortless.

The AI has to feel personal and actually helpful, not just “drink more water” advice.

Motivation comes from seeing patterns over time.

I changed my pitch to highlight simple and confidential. Next time, I want to dig into specifics—like how long people would actually spend logging and what would make the AI feel real.

Overall, I learned that talking to people reshapes your idea fast. What I thought was a “wellness app” is really a question of trust, ease, and whether the AI feels like it knows you.
