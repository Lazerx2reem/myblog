*November 9, 2025*

## Overview
Week 1 focused on foundations: setting up React, integrating Firebase, configuring Firestore, and building the basic one-click wellness logging UI. These core pieces are now in place and ready for future features.

---

## What I Accomplished
- Initialized React project and organized components.
- Connected Firebase SDK and configured Firestore.
- Built simple logging buttons (mood, sleep, hydration, workouts).
- Successfully stored logs in Firestore.

---

## Challenges
**Firebase setup:**  
Firestore rules and SDK configuration took longer than expected. Once permissions and imports were correct, everything clicked.

**UI scope control:**  
I had to avoid over-designing the logging interface. Keeping the UI minimal helped maintain focus on functionality.

**Architecture decisions:**  
I debated using global state early but decided to keep the setup simple until more components depend on shared state.

---

## What Went Well
- Firestore reads/writes worked smoothly after setup.
- Clean component structure will help in later sprints.
- Quick iteration with React helped validate features fast.

---

## Goals for Week 2
- Build the AI coach chat interface.
- Set up Firebase Functions for secure backend calls.
- Connect GPT-4 API and test the first prompt/response.
- Define the AI coach’s tone and system prompt.

## Final Thoughts
Week 1 laid a solid foundation. Even though it was mostly setup work, completing these tasks gives me momentum for Week 2, where the AI coach feature starts to take shape.
