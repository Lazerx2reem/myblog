## Key Learning Moments  

This week, I realized that many sectors in society need change and improvement. I also learned that success has different meanings for different people. Most importantly, I saw how AI can play a critical role in driving these improvements—whether in healthcare, education, or social justice. Technology is not just about efficiency but also about creating meaningful impact.  

## Personal Connections  

These ideas connected to me in two ways. First, they made me reflect on my goals—success is not just about career milestones but also about contributing to projects that help communities. Second, while working on this blog, I saw how even sharing reflections and knowledge online can be a small way to inspire change.  

## Challenges and Growth  

While building the blog, I struggled with styling and layout issues. Breaking problems into smaller steps, relying on documentation, and testing different solutions helped me overcome these challenges. Beyond the technical side, I grew in patience and problem-solving.  

## AI Tool Documentation  

I used **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** to organize my thoughts and refine this reflection. It helped structure the content into clear sections and make the writing flow more smoothly.
