# Week 7 Reflection

This week, I developed a prototype for a **wellness tracker website** that helps users **log habits, track mood, and see progress over time**. My goal was to design a layout that feels **calming, intuitive, and motivating**, so users can focus on self-improvement without feeling overwhelmed.

## Design Approach

I researched existing wellness apps and noticed many were either cluttered or too plain. I aimed for a balance by using **soft colors, clear typography, and simple charts** to make progress tracking feel encouraging rather than stressful. Small choices in layout and spacing made a big difference in how the interface felt to use.

## Personal Connection

This project felt personal since I’ve been working on building better routines myself. Designing this tracker made me realize how **thoughtful visuals and minimal interactions** can help people stay consistent with their goals. This project resonates with me since I have been in such situation and tried to help others in this too.

## Challenges and Tools

The biggest challenge was **feature selection**—deciding what to include without overwhelming users. I focused on just the essentials: **habit tracking, mood logging, and progress visualization**.  
I used **Gemini** to brainstorm layout ideas and **Bolt** to design and test an interactive dashboard, refining several versions before finalizing a **clean and user-friendly flow**.

## Takeaway

This week taught me that **simplicity and empathy** are key to good design. The best interfaces quietly guide users toward better habits without demanding too much attention.
