*November 23, 2025*

This week, I focused on enhancing my **WellMind AI MVP** by refining its **AI chat interface**, **mood logging**, and **personalized recommendation engine**. I learned how to use AI to suggest wellness activities based on user mood inputs and daily check-ins, making the experience feel responsive and human-centered.

### Key Learnings
- **AI-Driven Prompts and Recommendations:** I tested multiple AI-generated messages for stress management, motivation, and reflective journaling. This helped me identify which prompts were **engaging versus generic**, and adjust language and timing to encourage user interaction.
- **Guided Reflection Features:** AI-assisted mood reflections allowed the app to respond empathetically to user entries, enhancing the perceived usefulness of the logging feature.
- **Prompt Design Matters:** Integrating AI revealed how important careful **prompt engineering** is for creating actionable, human-centered guidance for wellness.
- **AI-Assisted Planning:** I used AI to structure my feature prioritization (MoSCoW), technology stack decision-making, and granular task breakdowns. This accelerated planning and helped avoid common integration pitfalls.
- **User Testing Insights:** Testing with users highlighted interface friction points, such as initial onboarding persistence and perceived delays during AI responses. Implementing a **typing indicator** and storing consent state improved the interaction flow.

### Overall Reflection
Integrating AI not only accelerated **feature development** but also demonstrated that creating empathetic, actionable guidance for mental health requires **thoughtful prompt design, user feedback, and iterative refinement**. By combining AI assistance with user-centered testing, I was able to make the app feel more personal, engaging, and supportive, even at the MVP stage.
