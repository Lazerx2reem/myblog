Week 4 Reflection

## Learning:


This week, I worked on a wellness and fitness tracker for students using Bolt.new for the web interface and a ChatGPT-powered chatbot for personalized tips on exercise, nutrition, and mental health. I also used Gradio so students could log workouts and wellness activities easily. I learned a lot about making dashboards user-friendly, showing progress visually, and designing motivating reminders.

## Impact:

It was cool seeing how AI could give practical advice, but I had to refine prompts to make it feel helpful and safe. Small UX changes—like color-coded progress bars and simple forms—made a big difference. The main challenge was balancing features with usability and making Gradio uploads smooth, but it was rewarding to combine AI with real student needs.
